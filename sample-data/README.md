# Sample Data

BODR Image Prompt does not commit runtime databases or user media. Optional sample data is provided as a curated bundle for screenshots, demos, and first-run exploration.

Sample installer command for normal release installs:

```bash
BODR-Image-Prompt sample-data zh_hant
# or: BODR-Image-Prompt sample-data zh_hans
# or: BODR-Image-Prompt sample-data en
```

Source/development checkout command for the default package:

```bash
./scripts/install-sample-data.sh zh_hant
# or: ./scripts/install-sample-data.sh zh_hans
# or: ./scripts/install-sample-data.sh en
```

A second sample package (`freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2`, Traditional Chinese manifest with source-language provenance and derived English translation prompts):

```bash
./scripts/install-sample-data.sh zh_hant awesome-gpt-image-2
```

The manifests in `sample-data/manifests/` are kept in git. The image files are distributed separately as release assets so normal clones stay lightweight. Each public sample item currently includes English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese prompt variants. Source/original text and derived machine translations or OpenCC conversions are marked in schema v2 prompt provenance. To refill missing variants during curation, install the optional curation dependencies and run:

```bash
python -m pip install deep-translator opencc-python-reimplemented
python backend/services/fill_sample_manifest_translations.py
```

Release assets:

| Package | Release tag | Asset | SHA256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-image-2-skill` | `sample-data-v1` | `BODR-Image-Prompt-sample-images-v1.zip` | `8a458f6c8c96079f40fbc46c689e7de0bd2eb464ee7f800f94f3ca60131d5035` |
| `awesome-gpt-image-2` | `sample-data-awesome-gpt-image-2-v1` | `BODR-Image-Prompt-awesome-gpt-image-2-sample-images-v1.zip` | `153714b7611524d7b98b4b0452baa86c8d05053477bb670b731953e8d26a8c9c` |

The installer verifies the downloaded ZIP against this checksum before import. To test a local ZIP override with checksum verification, pass `SAMPLE_DATA_IMAGE_ZIP_SHA256=<sha256>` together with `SAMPLE_DATA_IMAGE_ZIP=...`.

For local QA without downloading from GitHub, point the installer at a local image ZIP:

```bash
IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_PATH=.local-work/sample-demo SAMPLE_DATA_IMAGE_ZIP=.local-work/BODR-Image-Prompt-sample-images-v1.zip ./scripts/install-sample-data.sh en
IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_PATH=.local-work/awesome-gpt-image-2-demo SAMPLE_DATA_IMAGE_ZIP=.local-work/BODR-Image-Prompt-awesome-gpt-image-2-sample-images-v1.zip ./scripts/install-sample-data.sh zh_hant awesome-gpt-image-2
```

The curated sample sources are `wuyoscar/gpt_image_2_skill` and `freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2`. Preserve attribution and review the upstream licenses before publishing screenshots, demo GIFs, or release assets.
