# Maintainer Log

Last updated: 2026-07-11

This file records public-safe maintainer notes for the BODR Image Prompt project. It is intentionally more detailed than `ROADMAP.md`, but it should not contain private machine paths, credentials, runtime data, or local workflow details.

For the public product roadmap, see [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).

## Product direction

BODR Image Prompt is a local-first web app for saving generated images together with their prompts, collections, tags, and source metadata.

The public alpha target is a clone-and-run local install:

- FastAPI backend
- SQLite metadata store
- local media directory for images and thumbnails
- React/Vite frontend
- AGPL-3.0-or-later application code, with commercial licensing available for organizations that need terms outside the AGPL

## Public alpha status

Current public-alpha preparation is focused on:

- clear public README and roadmap
- reproducible local setup/start scripts
- configurable local library path and app ports
- safe media serving that does not expose database/config/internal files
- ignored runtime data and generated media
- optional sample library installer with separate sample image assets
- public sample attribution for third-party demo content
- tests/build passing from a fresh checkout

The repository is intended to stay safe for public release by keeping user runtime data, private imports, local working directories, backups, and generated application state out of git.

## Core UX decisions

### Browsing modes

The app has two primary browsing modes:

1. **Explore** — a thumbnail constellation view.
   - Collection cards act as hub nodes.
   - Image thumbnails are connected item nodes.
   - The view should remain visual; it should not degrade into abstract dot-only nodes.
   - Focus mode centers one selected collection and arranges its thumbnails in a stable, readable layout.

2. **Cards** — a masonry gallery view.
   - Designed for template-marketplace-style browsing density.
   - Preserves quick actions such as copy prompt, favorite, and edit.
   - Should remain stable while images load and while users scroll.

### Main layout

Current accepted layout decisions:

- No hero section; the search bar and gallery are the entry point.
- Keep the top toolbar with search, logo/brand area, filters entry, config entry, active filter/status strip, Explore/Cards toggle, and floating Add button.
- No command-palette search shortcut for now.
- Cards mode masonry is accepted and should not be replaced with a plain grid without a deliberate design decision.
- Explore focus view is accepted; future work should be minor tuning unless the direction changes.

### Detail and editing workflow

The detail modal should be the primary lightweight editing surface:

- title, collection, metadata, prompts, tags, and notes can be edited in place in local-install mode
- edits should use explicit confirm/cancel controls rather than blur-only auto-save
- read/detail prompt tabs should show English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese consistently, including empty tabs for languages that are missing or only machine-derived later
- the language that is the source/original prompt should be visually distinguished in both selected and unselected tab states, instead of requiring a long tab label such as `zh-Hans (Origin)` on the tab itself
- prompt labels follow UI language: English UI uses `English`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans`; Chinese UI uses `英文`, `繁中`, `簡中`; provenance badges/tooltips can still render `zh-Hans (Origin)` / `簡中（原文）` inside the prompt panel
- Origin is a first-class provenance property and should carry its detected/source language, but the editor should not expose a separate Origin prompt block
- prompt copy/edit actions apply to the active prompt tab
- Prompt Copy Language should include Origin/原文 in addition to English/英文, Traditional Chinese/繁中, and Simplified Chinese/簡中
- local-install edit mode should show exactly the normal prompt language blocks, each with an `is source/original` checkbox beside the block title; exactly one prompt can be marked original, and selecting a different one should require unchecking or otherwise explicitly moving the original marker
- empty prompt tabs remain clickable/editable in local-install mode so missing translations can be added later
- notes are separate from prompts and should stay visually lightweight when empty
- tags stay near the bottom with a clear add/remove flow

### Generation result workflow

GenerationJob is a temporary workbench/result inbox, not an automatic commit into the library. Generation results should not be silently attached to the source item. After a provider run completes, the user explicitly chooses the result disposition.

Final accepted direction for the next generation-UX batches:

- Result inbox cards expose an explicit accept action and discard action.
- Accept should become a split/dropdown action with two choices:
  - `Attach to current item`
  - `Save as new item`
- `Attach to current item` appends the generated image to the current item, keeps generation metadata, and shows a toast: `Image added to item`.
- `Save as new item` creates a new variant item whose primary image is the generated result, uses the generation prompt, preserves provenance back to the source item and GenerationJob, and shows a toast: `New variant item created` with a `View item` action.
- If an item has multiple images, the detail modal must support first-class image browsing: main image area, thumbnail/dot switcher, visible position such as `1 / 2`, and click-to-switch behavior.
- Generated/variant images should carry visible role/provenance badges where practical.
- Provider runs should show an animated shimmer/skeleton image placeholder in the result inbox rather than a plain spinner.
- When a result completes, the pending card should transition into the result card with a subtle fade-in.
- After accept, use toast feedback rather than an interrupting modal; when attaching, select/highlight the newly attached image in the item detail if possible.
- Manual result upload should be hidden or demoted from the primary generation flow. Its real purpose is uploading an externally generated result into a GenerationJob, not normal item creation; keep backend support available but do not present it beside the main provider run/accept controls unless exposed as an advanced/fallback action.

Current user-reported bugs to fix before adding more generation features:

- Accepted generated images can render as broken image placeholders instead of loading through the app media route.
- Items with more than one image cannot currently browse/switch to the second image from the detail UI.

### UI language and sample-vault behavior

The public GitHub Pages site should feel like a rich read-only prompt vault rather than a throwaway demo:

- public Pages default UI language should be English unless localStorage already contains a user preference
- switching UI language should update interface chrome, collection names, sample attribution/remark text, and prompt-language labels
- item titles should honor the source/original title and should not be auto-translated just because the UI language changes
- sample attribution/remark copy should begin with a UI-language-specific attribution sentence, then preserve source/license/manifest provenance
- the `English` option inside the UI-language selector should remain spelled `English`; other Chinese-mode labels can use `英文`
- public wording should describe Pages as a static read-only vault where visitors can browse/search/view/copy public sample prompts
- public wording should make clear that the main product value is the local-first library architecture/workflow, not ownership of the bundled sample images
- README/public docs should visibly thank the sample sources/contributors (`wuyoscar/gpt_image_2_skill` and `freestylefly/awesome-gpt-image-2`) and keep sample-content licensing separate from the app code license
- Add/Edit/private management should remain clearly local-install only
- the clone/local-install path should be informational and should not turn the Pages site into a checkout, SaaS, account, or commercial transaction flow

## Data and security rules

Runtime data and generated media must not be committed:

- `library/db.sqlite`
- `library/db.sqlite-*`
- `library/originals/`
- `library/thumbs/`
- `library/previews/`
- `.env`
- `backups/`
- `.local-work/`

Media serving rules:

- `/media` should only expose intended media files.
- Database, config, backups, and arbitrary local paths must not be reachable through `/media`.
- `GET /media/db.sqlite` should return 404.

Port convention:

- backend default: `127.0.0.1:8000`
- frontend dev default: `127.0.0.1:5177`
- avoid using `8787` for this app because that port may be reserved by other local tools

## Implemented public-release preparation

Recent preparation work includes:

- added public repo hygiene files: `SECURITY.md` and GitHub issue templates
- switched README project-status link to `ROADMAP.md`
- published sample-data release asset `sample-data-v1`
- updated public sample documentation around the release asset and private-repo visibility caveat
- removed source-specific gallery import workflows from the public app surface
- added tests guarding that removed importer surfaces stay absent
- added tests guarding public docs, install helpers, runtime ignore rules, and media lockdown
- pinned frontend dependency versions instead of using `latest`
- added tests preventing npm dependency specs from regressing to `latest`
- added a GitHub Pages read-only online sandbox build using static JSON and compressed public sample images
- added demo-mode guards that keep browsing/search/copy available while disabling Add/Edit/Favorite/tag/prompt mutations
- added a compact demo-data export script for the public sample library and regression tests for the Pages workflow, demo disclosure, and generated static bundle
- added a GitHub Actions CI workflow for Python tests, local frontend build, and demo build
- drafted `docs/releases/v0.1.0-alpha.md` as public-safe alpha release notes
- verified a fresh clone setup/start/smoke-test path on a non-reserved port with Python 3.12, including empty-library onboarding and public sample-library installation
- after public release, set the GitHub repo homepage to the read-only sandbox URL, polished README badges/release/demo affordances, drafted launch-post copy in the MacBook Downloads folder, verified unauthenticated public sample-data installation, and added SHA256 verification for the sample image ZIP
- verified tests and frontend build before the latest public-alpha preparation commit
- promoted the previous preview to `v0.3.0-alpha` positioning: a multilingual provenance-aware prompt vault rather than a small patch on the 0.2 mobile preview
- prepared `v0.4.0-alpha` positioning around local ChatGPT OAuth direct image generation, versioned installer/update/rollback, and an Online Read Only Demo banner that keeps GitHub Pages non-mutating
- added versioned `/v0.4/` Pages output while preserving `/v0.3/`, `/v0.2/`, and `/v0.1/` as archived previews

## Sample data notes

The public sample path is the optional sample library installer:

```bash
./scripts/install-sample-data.sh en
./scripts/install-sample-data.sh zh_hant awesome-gpt-image-2
```

Sample metadata manifests live in `sample-data/manifests/`. Larger sample image bundles are distributed separately as release assets so runtime/generated media are not committed to the repo.

Sample content must preserve third-party attribution and license metadata. The app's own code license does not automatically relicense sample content.

Sample manifests now use a formal `schema_version: 2` provenance contract:

- each item identifies exactly one existing prompt language as Origin/原文, rather than adding a separate editable Origin prompt block
- the origin/source prompt records its detected/source language (`en`, `zh_hant`, `zh_hans`, or another explicit language code when needed)
- source-provided English and Chinese prompts remain source text unless explicitly marked as derived
- Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion is marked as derived when generated from the other Chinese script
- machine-translated prompt variants are explicitly marked as derived/translated; current sample manifests now carry English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese prompt records for every public sample item
- README/demo copy explains that the original/source prompt is normally the best prompt to reproduce a result close to the sample image
- collection names are localized via manifest metadata, while titles preserve upstream/source wording
- the static demo bundle combines both sample packages and exports 510 compressed public sample references

## Verification checklist

Before switching the repository public or tagging an alpha release, verify:

- `python -m pytest -q`
- `npm run build`
- `git diff --check`
- no tracked runtime database/media/backups/local-work artifacts
- no credentials or secret-looking values in the current tree
- no private machine paths in public docs
- fresh clone setup succeeds with Python 3.10+
- app starts on non-reserved ports
- `/api/health` returns OK
- unknown `/api/*` routes return 404
- `/media/db.sqlite` returns 404
- empty-library first-run UI has a clear Add action
- sample installer works after public release assets are reachable without authentication

## Mobile UX direction

The next product polish focus is a mobile-native experience rather than a scaled-down desktop layout:

- Mobile should default to **Cards** when there is no saved user view preference; Cards is the primary mobile browsing mode.
- Mobile Cards should support dense browsing with a stable two-column masonry layout on phones, with touch-visible actions for copy/favorite/edit flows.
- Mobile Explore should be a contained interactive canvas: the page itself should not pinch-zoom or distort while the Explore surface supports one-finger pan and two-finger pinch zoom.
- Mobile Explore layout should favor a vertical constellation/spine distribution instead of a wide desktop-style map.
- Mobile detail view should stack image above content. The close control floats at the top-right of the image area; favorite and edit controls float at the image bottom-right; prompt, metadata, tags, and notes sit below.
- Mobile Filters, Config, and Manage surfaces should use full-height drawers/sheets with internal scrolling and safe-area padding.
- Mobile management remains in scope: add/edit, result image upload, optional reference image, multilingual prompts, tags, favorite, and archive/delete should be usable on a phone.

Recommended implementation order:

1. Mobile shell and Cards default/columns/actions.
2. Mobile detail modal stack and copy/favorite/edit controls.
3. Full-height mobile drawers for Filters, Config, and Manage.
4. Mobile Explore gesture containment, vertical layout, and mobile thumbnail budgets.

## Known follow-ups

Next implementation focus:

0. **Versioned installer / updater — MVP implemented, release publication next**: normal users can install/update a tagged release without cloning the repo or running `git pull`. The installer downloads GitHub Release artifacts, verifies SHA256, extracts versioned app directories under `~/.BODR-Image-Prompt/app/versions/`, switches `app/current`, preserves durable user data outside app code, and supports selected versions plus rollback. Release artifacts include the built frontend at `frontend/dist`, so normal release installs do not require Node.js. Remaining work is to push/tag the next public release and verify real GitHub Release download end-to-end.
1. **ImportDraft core — done in backend**: persistent schema/storage, preview/list/detail/confirm API, duplicate checks, derived Traditional Chinese normalization on accepted items, and accept-draft writes into the normal library repository layer are implemented and tested.
2. **Repository/dataset ingestion MVP — done for local markdown repositories**: the backend scans local markdown folders, extracts heading/fenced-prompt/image records, stages local image assets safely under the selected library, preserves source file/ref metadata, and emits ImportDraft records for review. Remote GitHub clone/download orchestration and richer dataset-specific parsers remain future hardening.
3. **GenerationJob plus result inbox foundation — done in backend**: provider-agnostic generation job records, manual/stub result staging under `generation-results/`, list/detail review API, accept/discard lifecycle, accept-to-current-item media attachment, and save-as-new-variant behavior are implemented and tested.
4. **`openai_codex_oauth_native` provider — backend/provider UI slices done**: app-owned native Codex auth store outside the library, frontend-ready optional provider status/list API, device-code start/poll/disconnect helpers, env/local-config client-id bootstrap, token refresh before expiry, Codex-compatible headers, `POST /api/generation-jobs/{job_id}/run` can stage Codex image results into the GenerationJob inbox, and the frontend Config drawer lists providers plus native Codex connect/poll/disconnect controls. Fresh OAuth onboarding QA, refresh lock hardening, reference/edit modes, model configuration UI, and retry controls remain follow-ups.
5. **Generation UX/result inbox frontend — local slice implemented**: item detail views can launch `Generate variant` only when a provider is connected, standalone Generate is available in local installs with a connected provider, GenerationJobs can be reviewed in a result inbox, generated results can attach to the current item or save as a new variant item after metadata review/edit, multi-image detail browsing works, manual result upload is demoted as an advanced/fallback action, and public GitHub Pages remains read-only.
6. **Generation workflow polish — implemented for current local slice**: provider availability refreshes after OAuth without manual browser refresh, confirm-save closes the generation page and returns to the library, mobile Generate variant is provider-gated, mobile save-as-new auto-scrolls/focuses the metadata edit panel, a compact generation queue drawer shows active/succeeded/failed jobs, and policy/rate-limit/auth/provider failures use friendly states.
7. **Generic URL plus X/Threads import** — public URL extraction and social-post/thread import behind local-only/experimental warnings.
8. **Instagram import** — later experimental adapter only after generic URL and X/Threads are useful.

Public-alpha follow-ups that remain useful:

- enable private vulnerability reporting in GitHub settings if available
- consider native Windows PowerShell scripts or Docker Compose for easier cross-platform setup
- add export/import backup archive UI
- continue mobile Explore gesture/contained-canvas polish after the current Cards/detail improvements
- consider optional semantic/vector search

Private/local generation follow-ups:

- Batch 3 provider-adapter generation foundation is now implemented in the backend: `POST /api/generation-jobs` creates provider-agnostic jobs, `POST /api/generation-jobs/{job_id}/result` stages manual/stub result images under `generation-results/`, `GET /api/generation-jobs` and `GET /api/generation-jobs/{job_id}` support review/inbox reads, and accept/discard endpoints finalize the result. Accepted images are copied through normal media storage into `originals/`, `thumbs/`, and `previews/` before attaching to the source item.
- Batch 4 `openai_codex_oauth_native` backend/provider UI slices are now implemented: `backend/services/openai_codex_native.py` owns the app-native auth store (`~/.BODR-Image-Prompt/auth.json` by default, overrideable via `IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_AUTH_PATH`), frontend-ready provider status (`not_configured` / `not_connected` / `connected`), public native Codex OAuth client-id default with env/local-config override (`IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_CODEX_CLIENT_ID` or `~/.BODR-Image-Prompt/config.json` / `IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_CONFIG_PATH`), redacted token status, device-code start/poll helpers, disconnect, access-token refresh before expiry, `ChatGPT-Account-ID` JWT header extraction, Codex-compatible headers, Codex Responses `image_generation` streaming, and result staging through the existing GenerationJob inbox. `backend/routers/generation_providers.py` exposes list/status/auth endpoints, `backend/routers/generation_jobs.py` exposes `POST /api/generation-jobs/{job_id}/run`, `scripts/codex_native_oauth_smoke.py` provides backend-only live OAuth/generation smoke commands, and `frontend/src/components/ConfigPanel.tsx` now lists manual/native Codex provider cards with connect, poll, and disconnect controls while keeping GitHub Pages demo mode read-only/local-only. Cross-process refresh lock hardening, Text+Reference/Image Edit payloads, model configuration UI, and retry controls remain follow-ups.
- Batch 4.4 through 4.7 generation UX is implemented for the current local slice: local item detail views expose provider-gated `Generate variant`, standalone Generate appears only when a provider is connected, GenerationJobs are reviewed through a result inbox, manual external upload is demoted, generated images load through the app media route, item detail supports multiple images with thumbnail/counter browsing, users choose `Attach to current item` or `Save as new item`, save-as-new opens an editable metadata review panel before creating a variant item, confirm-save returns to the library, provider availability refreshes after OAuth without a manual browser refresh, mobile save-as-new scrolls/focuses the metadata editor, a compact generation queue drawer shows work status, and friendly failure states cover policy/rate-limit/auth/provider errors.
- keep `openai_codex_oauth_native` local-only and experimental; it uses the ChatGPT/Codex backend, not the stable public OpenAI Images API
- device-code login should create this app's own OAuth session and token store, separate from other local auth stores by default
- token storage must live outside the library/export/demo data path, use restrictive permissions, refresh before expiry, and never enter git, sample bundles, backups, or GitHub Pages exports; cross-process refresh locking remains follow-up hardening
- request handling must decode the OAuth JWT for `ChatGPT-Account-ID`, send Codex-compatible originator/user-agent headers, call the Codex Responses API with the `image_generation` tool and `gpt-image-2`, parse streamed base64 image output, and save results into a local review inbox
- generated-output provenance should record provider `openai_codex_oauth_native`, auth mode `codex_oauth_native`, model/provider details, quality/size/aspect ratio, prompt variant, reference images, source item id, generation job id, timestamps, and user disposition

Import and agent-ingestion follow-ups:

- Batch 1 ImportDraft core is now implemented in the backend: source adapters can create persistent draft records with prompts/media/provenance metadata, reviewers can list/preview drafts, duplicate drafts are detected by source URL or normalized prompt text, and accepted drafts create normal library items through the existing repository layer.
- Batch 2 repository/dataset ingestion MVP is implemented for local markdown repositories: `POST /api/import-drafts/repository` scans a local folder, extracts Markdown heading/fenced-prompt/image records, stages image assets under `import-staging/`, stores image dimensions/SHA256 when available, preserves repo URL/ref/source path metadata, and emits ImportDraft records for review before accept.
- future repository-ingestion hardening should add remote GitHub clone/download orchestration, richer dataset-specific parser adapters, license/attribution extraction, and optional tag suggestions
- add an agent skill / adapter to pull X/Twitter and Threads post or thread URLs into `ImportDraft` records with public post text, media, source URL, author/handle, quoted/replied context when accessible, and suggested collection/tags
- add a generic public URL import adapter for article/post pages that can extract visible text, images, Open Graph metadata, author/source metadata, candidate prompts, and suggested collection/tags into reviewable drafts
- track Instagram URL import as a later experimental adapter rather than the first URL-import target, because login/browser-session requirements and anti-bot behavior are likely
- implement repository/dataset ingestion before URL/social import because repos are more stable and testable; then do generic URL plus X/Threads; only consider Instagram after those are useful
- both import flows must preserve source/original text, generate Traditional Chinese only as a marked derived variant when applicable, deduplicate by source URL/image hash/normalized prompt text, and never run inside the public read-only Pages demo

## Product library (categories + series + cover images)

The product library is the second primary surface of the app (alongside the item gallery). Each product owns a name, optional category and series, an optional spec / selling-points block, and 1..N images with a designated cover. Categories and series are stored as separate dictionaries and surfaced as dropdowns in the editor.

### Category ↔ series parent/child linkage

Categories and series are a parent/child relationship. The frontend filters the series dropdown by the selected category, so that selecting a category hides unrelated series and selecting a category with no products leaves the series list empty.

Implementation:

- The series endpoint accepts an optional `?category_id=N` query parameter; when supplied, the backend filters the returned series to those used by products in that category.
- The frontend editor calls `api.products.listSeries(category_id?)` whenever the user changes the category dropdown, then repopulates the series dropdown with the response. The currently selected series value is preserved across the refresh (no automatic reset) to avoid mid-edit races.
- Series dictionary entries are stored independently from any category — a series can exist without belonging to any product. This keeps the dictionaries decoupled from products and avoids the cost of migrating series every time a category is added.

### Edge cases

- A series dict item may belong to a category that has zero products; in that case the category appears in the editor with an empty series list.
- Selecting a category whose products do not use the previously selected series leaves the series dropdown empty until the user picks a new one. The frontend does not auto-clear the value to avoid silent data loss on accidental category switches.

## Image upload compression

All uploaded images go through `backend/services/image_store.py`, which normalizes every accepted format to WebP using Pillow (no extra system libraries). The frontend exposes a per-request on/off toggle in Config → "Image compression" (default: **On**).

Rules of thumb:

- Default is on. Off keeps the user's original bytes + extension (PNG/JPG/etc.) untouched.
- When on: PNG/GIF → WebP lossless; JPEG/JPG → WebP q95; WebP → WebP q95. Result is ~80% smaller on a typical mixed library.
- Storage is always `.webp` after compression, so the frontend only needs to load `<img src="...webp">` regardless of the source format.
- Original bytes are not recoverable after compression. If a future migration must preserve originals, take a one-time tar backup of `library/originals/` before flipping the toggle.

Anti-patterns:

- Do not store original bytes by default — a single 40 MB photo per product quickly fills the library.
- Do not introduce oxipng / pngquant / mozjpeg — Pillow already covers the formats we accept.
- Do not switch to AVIF — encode latency is 3-5x and Safari support is recent.


## Maintainer note policy

Keep this file public-safe:

- Do not include credentials, tokens, private URLs, private machine paths, or local chat/tooling notes.
- Do not include user runtime library data or screenshots that reveal private content.
- Prefer durable product decisions, verification notes, and release-preparation state.
- Put temporary local scratch notes in ignored local work files instead of this tracked document.
