# Local Generation Guide

Local installs can optionally connect **ChatGPT / Codex OAuth** for image generation. The GitHub Pages Online Read Only Demo stays read-only and does not expose generation or mutation controls.

## What the local generation flow does

Once connected, you can:

- Generate a new image from a fresh prompt.
- Generate a variant from an existing reference.
- Review generated results before saving them into the library.
- Attach a result to the current item.
- Save a result as a new item with editable metadata.
- Keep generated-output provenance such as provider, model, source item, generation job, and timestamps.
- Use prompt variables such as `{{subject}}`, `{{style}}`, or `{{主體}}` in reusable template prompts and fill them before each generation.

No OpenAI API key is required by the app for the ChatGPT / Codex OAuth path. Advanced provider configuration is available for users who need it, but the normal flow is handled from the Config drawer.

## Privacy boundary

Generation is local-install only. The public GitHub Pages demo does not perform live imports or generation and does not expose Add/Edit/private-library controls.

The app-owned auth store lives outside the prompt library by default. Tokens must never be committed to git, sample bundles, backups, or GitHub Pages exports.

## Connect the provider

Open **Config → Providers**. Manual upload is always available; the ChatGPT / Codex OAuth provider is optional.

</p>

Choose **Connect**. The app opens a device-login step: follow the verification link, enter the displayed user code, and then return to BODR Image Prompt to check authorization.

</p>

The browser approval page may say **Codex CLI** because the current beta provider uses the Codex OAuth device flow behind the scenes. Only approve it if you started the flow yourself from your local BODR Image Prompt app.

</p>

After approval, the provider card should show **Connected** and list the available generation modes. Account details should be treated as private; the screenshot below is redacted.

## Generate and review results

Open the local generation composer, type a prompt, choose the desired controls, and run **Generate**. Use double braces for reusable fields, for example `A portrait of {{subject}} in {{style}}`; the composer shows fields for each variable and previews the resolved prompt before sending.

</p>

When the result appears, you can inspect the generated image, download it, attach it to the current item, create another variant, or delete the result.

</p>

If you save a result as a new library item, review and edit the metadata first. The saved item keeps readonly provenance for the generation job, provider, and model.

## Current provider notes

The current beta line includes an experimental `openai_codex_oauth_native` provider path labelled in the UI as **ChatGPT / Codex OAuth**.

Current hardening follow-ups include:

- Cross-process token refresh locking.
- Fresh OAuth onboarding QA.
- Clearer error mapping for auth expiry, Cloudflare/challenge, empty image results, and upstream API drift.
- Text+Reference to Image and Image Edit payload support using `reference_image_ids`.
- Retry controls and richer job state transitions.
- More complete local-only Generation UX polish.

## Benchmark note

While building BODR Image Prompt's Image 2.0 generation workflow, the project also benchmarked which Codex/ChatGPT backend tool-calling model and quality setting worked best for this app. The test covered GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, and GPT-5.3-Codex across Low, Medium, and High quality.

The practical beta default is **GPT-5.4 + High**: acceptable speed with the strongest visual quality in those tests. Users can still change both the tool-calling model and quality setting manually.
